Extra Credit 1.2 - Unittest and pytest the Reverse sentence program

1.  Write a program that reverses a sentence. Input - ask the user for a sentence:
    a long string containing multiple words. Return to the user the same string,
    with the words in backward order.

    Write tests for the reverse_sentence program using unittest and pytest. 
    (do not run the tests with pytest alone - you should use pytest syntax as well.)

--- For pytest to run correctly, you must tag it with "-s" to gain user input. ie,
    "pytest -s .\test_reverse_sentence.py" in command prompt

2.
